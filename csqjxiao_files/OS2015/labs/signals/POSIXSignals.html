	In this lab, we will learn about using POSIX (Unix)
	signals. The POSIX standard for signals, as with most of its
	components was based on UNIX semantics, but generalized to
	avoid explicitly endorsing one version of UNIX or another. The
	POSIX standard for signals and other aspects of system support
	are often supported by other operating systems. As with the
	other labs in this class we will experiment with signals in
	the context of Linux. We will also construct a small program
	which associates signal handlers with a few signals to give
	more interesting functionality to the starter code provided.
      </p>

      <p>
	In this lab we will ensure you see how signals are used by
	BASH to support job control, which is an interesting feature,
	if slightly less widely used than it was a number of years
	ago. We will also look at a simple user program and change it
	in ways demonstrating:
	<ul>
	  <li> Definition of signal handlers </li>
	  <li> Association of handlers and signals </li>
	  <li> Use of system calls related to signals: alarm(), pause() </li>
	</ul>

  </TR>
    <TD colspan=2>
      <p> 
	For this lab, you need to complete the implementation of the
	<string>signals.c</string> program.  This program should count
	the number of times the user has sent the SIGINT signal to the
	running process. Pressing Ctl-C from the keyboard send this signal.
	When the process receives the SIGTSTP signal (Ctl-Z), it should
	print to the terminal the number of SIGINT signals it has
	received. After it receives 5 SIGINT signals, the program should
	prompt the user to exit. If the user does not respond within
	10 seconds, an SIGALRM signal should force the program to exit.
      </p>

      <p> 
	The TA should be able to build the program using the Makefile
	submitted with your solution. An example output of running
	signals is shown below:
      </p>

      <pre>
	bash> ./signals 
	^C^C^C^C^C
	Really exit? [Y/n]: n

	Continuing
	^C^C^C^Z

	So far, '3' Ctl-C presses were counted

	^C^Z

	So far, '4' Ctl-C presses were counted

	^C
	Really exit? [Y/n]: n

	Continuing
	^C^C^C^C^C
	Really exit? [Y/n]: 
	User taking too long to respond. Exiting  . . .

  WHAT TO HAND IN
      </FONT>
	</TD>
  </TR>
    <TD colspan=2>
      <p>
    After you have finished your implementation, you need to complete a short
    report that answers the following questions:
      </p>
      <ol> 
	  <li> 
	    There are two special signals (KILL and STOP) which are
	    not handled by the process they are sent to. When a KILL
	    or STOP signal is generated, the operating system itself
	    handles this signal and kills or stops the appropriate
	    process. Considering what you learned in today's lab,
	    speculate as to why the system designers chose to include
	    signals which are handled solely by the operating system.
	  </li>

	  <li> 
	    What benefit do we gain from using the pause system
	    call as opposed to an infinite while loop?
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    Why do we mask other signals while inside the signal handler?
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    When we implement the time out, we do not mask the SIGALRM signal. Why?
	  </li>
      </ol>

    You also need to tar up your lab for submission. For this step, you should
    use the 'tar' target included in the lab's Makefile. Change the STUDENT_ID
    variable in the Makefile to your student ID and type:
	  <PRE>
    make tar
	  </PRE>
